# ServerClient

Multi-threaded Client-Server connection system implementing producer-consumer synchronization, developed as part of the Concurrent Programming course, belonging to the Computer Engineering degree at Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM).

The core of the project is a system that allows multiple clients to access a server simultaneously to share and download information about football teams. The architecture serves as a medium for real-time information exchange, demonstrating advanced skills in concurrency, thread safety, and synchronized access to shared data. While the current implementation focuses on football team data, the underlying logic is designed to be scalable for other types of shared resources.

This project was developed in collaboration with Sergio Martínez Olivera (https://github.com/sergiio8).
